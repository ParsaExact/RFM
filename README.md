# Random Feature Method (RFM) for Partial Differential Equations

This repository contains my research work on the Random Feature Method (RFM), a novel numerical approach for solving partial differential equations that combines the advantages of classical numerical methods with machine learning techniques.

## üîç Overview

The Random Feature Method is a meshfree numerical approach that bridges classical numerical methods and machine learning for solving PDEs. Unlike traditional finite difference or finite element methods that rely on mesh generation, RFM uses random feature functions to construct numerical solutions while maintaining the linear optimization framework of classical methods.

### Key Advantages
- **Meshfree**: No complex mesh generation required, handles complex geometries easily
- **Linear Optimization**: Avoids non-convex optimization issues common in neural network approaches
- **Spectral Accuracy**: Achieves high convergence rates
- **Scalable**: Suitable for high-dimensional problems
- **Stable**: Maintains theoretical convergence guarantees
